TODO
==========

High Priority:
 * Needs pingback
 * Needs RSS link
 * Needs Meda information in head
 * Needs forward and back buttons on article page
 * Integrate google analytics

Lower Priority:
 * Article list doesn't look nice when there aren't any articles.
 * Wordpress import only imports posts and pages and doesn't port over multiple authors--
     the author must be specified explicitly on import
